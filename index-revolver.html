<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolver">information</a>The rise of the revolver, as a crucial step in the history of firearms, began in the 16th century in Europe. The early revolvers, also known as "wheellocks" were crude and inefficient by modern standards, but they paved the way for a new way of thinking about weapons. Their revolving cylinder mechanism, which loaded cartridges, was revolutionary for its time.

Over the centuries, revolvers evolved and improved in the hands of inventors and engineers like Samuel Colt. In 1836, Colt patented a model that not only enhanced the effectiveness of the revolver but also made it more accessible and easier to use. This model, called the "Colt Python," became a symbol of American civilian defense and law enforcement. It can almost instantly, after cocking the hammer, fire five shots, after which there is a slow reload, common in its time, of pushing little balls in each hole and pouring powder in.</h2>			<section id="skip">

             <h4>
                 In 1873 Samuel Colt invented the Colt Single Action Army, "Peacemaker" or "Cattleman's Gun", which became the symbol of the Wild West and started being used not only in the USA, but as far away as Indonesia in the 20th century, even after double action firearms where invented. That was because of its lightness, accuracy, its decent caliber of 11.43x23mm, its mass production and popularity, and most importantly, the new mechanism where you just put a round in each hole. It can now fire six shots.

                 As the 20th century dawned, revolvers continued to undergo innovations, including the introduction of automatic reloading mechanisms and more powerful calibers. Military conflicts such as the First and Second World Wars made them an indispensable part of military strategy.

             <h4>
                 Today, revolvers are valued by collectors and shooting enthusiasts, but they also remain real weapons for self-defense and law enforcement. Whether viewed as a symbol of personal freedom or as an engineering marvel, revolvers carry with them the history of human innovation and the pursuit of better weaponry.

             <h4>
                 The Schofield is a historic revolver popular during the American West in the 19th century. It is known for its distinctive design that includes a hole in the top of the cylinder for loading and exceptional durability. Schofield revolvers were used by the United States Army and other military forces during this period. Although it wasn't that popular and common, it is very accurate and easy to handle, and very expensive.

             <h4>
                 This type of revolver can be double-action, meaning that the bolt can be pressed to fire while pre-cocking the trigger spring, rather single-action, where the trigger spring cocked manually before each shot. This design provides greater flexibility and convenience when using the revolver.

                 This type of revolver requires the trigger spring to be tensioned manually before each shot, with the bullet only being lowered afterwards. This design is more difficult to use than double-action revolvers, but some shooters prefer its simplicity and control. It's also much more reliable and accurate.
